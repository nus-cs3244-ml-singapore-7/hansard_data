Rising sea levels may put coastal areas underwater. Floods may become more frequent. Developers will have to build at higher levels than before. Tens of billions of taxpayer dollars will have to be spent on massive projects, such as building polders.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Singapore has always managed to build our way around problems. We built upwards, touching the sky with skyscrapers and HDB blocks. We built outwards, reclaiming land from the sea. We built our NEWater plants, turning waste into water. But climate change is not an ecological threat that our engineers can just build around. It is an economic and political threat.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Near and far from our borders, cities and villages will face the test of climate change. Some will sink into the ocean. Others will be consumed by wildfires. Farms and fisheries will be reshaped, disrupting supply chains.\u00a0The polar ice caps will melt, opening new shipping routes that bypass Singapore\u2019s port. There may be price instability. Businesses and consumers will both be affected. There may even be geopolitical conflicts over water resources.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "In other words, we cannot hope to escape climate change through superior engineering and high-quality design. Globalisation means climate change will find a way to hit our livelihoods, our breadbaskets and our peace.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "This brings me to the second reason we have brought the Motion to this House: it upholds Singapore's reputation of fulfilling our international commitments.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "As Minister Vivian will tell you, we are a little red dot, but there is nothing little about our voice. We have led negotiations in the most significant multilateral agreements of our time.\u00a0We have hosted peace summits, had UN conventions named after us and had our people elected to lead UN agencies.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "All this is made possible because our diplomats at MFA and our Public Service work so hard. But it is also made possible because Singapore has a reputation for responding when the international community calls.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "So, our Motion today responds to what is perhaps the most critical call of our century \u2013 former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon's call that every country must take urgent, immediate action to combat climate change.\u00a0More than anyone else, Singapore understands the significance of going together, not going alone. On these rough tides, every pair of hands counts.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "We have signed the Paris Climate Agreement, but we must do more. Our recommendations today provide specific proposals on what we can do.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Our third and last reason for bringing this Motion here today is that it responds to voices Members of this House must all have heard. These voices come from Singaporeans, young and old. In the past few years we have seen them build, organise, research, educate and advocate to move the needle on climate change.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Let me start with a voice from the private sector.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Esther has been City Developments Limited's Chief Sustainability Officer for over 25 years. It really is not common to see a business leader advocate about climate change like she does.\u00a0In one breath, she is talking about Sustainable Cities Index; in another, she is casually dropping data about Canada's climate change policy.\u00a0Let me quote her interview with Eco-Business: \"We should ask ourselves what sort of solutions can really tackle the climate emergency and how we can take action. There is no point in just talking if you do not take action.\"\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Good thing, she also walks the talk. She has worked with her company to cut emissions, secure green loans, fund green start-ups and create awareness campaigns. She has won the SDG Pioneer award, given by the UN to business leaders who have done an outstanding job advancing their Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Despite all her time working with titans of industry, her inspiration comes from youths. To quote her again, from interview with The Edge: \"Given their energy and desire for a bright future, youths play a vital role in helping our planet to recover from the harm humans have inflicted. We need to engage, encourage and empower youths to drive the green agenda and impart them with the necessary skillsets and tools to drive sustainability for decades to come.\"\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "I could not agree with her more about youths being the future. I have spoken with many of them in the past few years and decades. Let me share a few of the personal stories they shared with me.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Xiang Tian is a young man studying at the Singapore Institute of Technology. You may have seen him holding a microphone and giving a heartfelt speech at the Singapore Climate Rally in 2019. But his passion for the environment goes much further back. It started in kindergarten, when NEA gave out a Green Package to his class. His memory is vivid: it was three books and one music CD, instructing him on how Singapore will pile up with trash if he did not reduce, reuse and recycle.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "And so he did. But that was not enough. He learned, as we all do, that big problems require big solutions. So, he started studying engineering, with an eye on finding solutions. He connected with other passionate people. He founded LepakSG, which consolidates environmental events in a single calendar.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "\"Lepak\" means relax, but he is nothing but hard work. In fact, what he finds energising is that the climate change community are the kind of people who, like him, are happy to volunteer their Friday nights and weekends discussing problems, researching solutions, gathering feedback, reaching out to public agencies.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "\"No one is Superman,\" he told me. \"We cannot save the world by ourselves. But we can move others and we can change systems.\" And that is exactly what he is doing and, as many of us know, he is doing this while infamously always wearing his slippers.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Like Xiang Tian, Lastrina found a connection with the environment at a young age. Her dad came from Pulau Sakijang Pelepah, or what some of you may know as Lazarus Island.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Growing up around sea captains and divers, she gained a natural appreciation for the environment. But almost 10 years ago, she heard what the experts were saying about climate change. \"Something worrying was happening,\" she said. It was time to graduate from appreciating the environment to helping it.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "And so, in 2015, she started the Singapore Youth for Climate Action with some friends. She understands instinctively how powerless other youths feel in today's world.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "The solution, she says, is to shine the light on what they can do. Speak up. Organise. Collaborate. Build a movement. Talk to decision makers. Everyone has a role to play. Her message is one of empowerment, and Singapore is lucky to have her.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Sir, I am happy to share that our People's Action Party's youth wing also has its own activists passionate about sustainability and climate change.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "For Wei-Shan from our Young PAP, or YP, sustainability has a lot to do with changing people's mindsets.\u00a0She has first-hand experience with this. Running a business that designs gifts, she found that clients would almost always opt for plastic packaging even when she recommended greener alternatives. Hard to change people's minds, she says.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "It is a challenge, but it is one we cannot shy away from. That is why the many public consultations organised by Wei-Shan and her passionate team mates at YP brought industry experts and climate activists to the same table. Each party gets the chance to persuade and be persuaded. Good policy, she says, must balance the viewpoints of different groups.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Wei-Shan is also a mother of two young children. We are used to seeing their faces during our many Zoom calls. These little ones fuel her passion for sustainability. \"I want the world to be better for them in 10, 20 years\u2019; not worse,\" she says.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Like Wei-Shan, Cynthia's passion is informed by her work. Having worked for over 10 years in the maritime sector, an industry at the heart of global business, she recalls that MNCs were working on sustainability, even before it became a buzzword in Singapore.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "That is why she believes good climate policy must be pragmatic. Of course, it must reduce emissions, and of course, it must ensure the welfare of Singaporeans. But the path to that outcome should involve working with the private sector. Acknowledge their concerns. Help them find alternatives. They have the capacity to change, and we all benefit if we help them to do so.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "That is why Cynthia and her passionate team of activists at the YP climate change policy team envision such an important role for businesses in their position papers.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "But business aside, climate change is, for Cynthia, about responsibility. \"We have treated the Earth badly,\" she says. It is time we do what is right for the future generations.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "I hope Members of this House do not make the mistake of thinking any of these people work alone. Xiang Tian, Lastrina, Wei-Shan and Cynthia were all at pains to emphasise the work of others. They are just four names amongst thousands in Singapore who are waging the battle against climate change in their own ways.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "We may not agree with everything climate activists say or do. But let us pause and remember: these are Singaporeans who care deeply about helping and protecting something other than themselves. Is that not something we should cherish?\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Just as importantly, they speak up because they believe in the capacity of this Government to listen. Is that not something we should respond to?\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "And so we should. This Motion today responds to their call.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Today, my fellow MPs and I will discuss 10 topics. Let me kickstart the discussion with the first topic: stepping up sustainability standards in the Public Service.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Government is big business. In 2016, our 35,000 Government contracts were worth a whopping $22.6 billion. As the largest employer and one of the biggest business clients in Singapore, the Government can move the standard business practices of entire industries, just by enhancing its sustainability standards.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "It is good that we have the Public Service Taking The Lead in Environmental Sustainability initiative. It is also good news that Minister Grace Fu said last year that the Government is already looking at a sustainable framework for Government procurement.\u00a0We should ensure that these higher standards are robust.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "First, life-cycle costing should be expanded to more categories of products.\u00a0Life-cycle costing is simple. It means when we buy something, we look not just at the price tag, but also at how much it will cost us to maintain, use and dispose.\u00a0This practice helps us spend less and waste less.\u00a0The Government currently requires its agencies to do it only for electrical appliances. We should do it also for vehicles, furniture and other products.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Second, Government contracts should measure and set standards for carbon footprints. It is already a common practice in Europe. We should mandate it, especially, for high-emissions infrastructure projects.\u00a0In addition, we can increase standards on accredited efficiency. For example, public procurement standards currently require air-conditioners to have only three ticks of efficiency. We can raise the standard to four or five ticks, which will save us money in the long run while cutting emissions.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Third, every Ministry should be required to publish a yearly Sustainability Report.\u00a0This can just be an adapted version of the confidential Resource Management Plans that they already must prepare. It will tell the public how each Ministry is greening its operations.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "To sum up, we can do a lot by enhancing our Government's sustainability standards.\u00a0I will also note that many of our Government's contractors also service other clients.\u00a0When we tighten our sustainability requirements, it can spark process improvements across the supply chain, creating a multiplied effect.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "But Sir, the Government's work does not stop at its procurement or its operations. It sets policies, and this means there are a lot more things it can do.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "My colleagues will focus on nine other topics and propose changes in policies.\u00a0Again, these proposals were formulated from over a year of public consultations with business leaders, researchers, activists and fellow Singaporeans.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Some of the ideas were sparked by YP's Climate Change policy team. The Members' various legislative assistants also contributed to making this happen. My thanks to my own climate change team, led by Elliot. They have done extraordinary work.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Sir, the first topic is carbon tax. The carbon tax is perhaps Singapore's most important policy tool against climate change. I agree that we needed to start low to avoid spooking investors and I agree that our economy needs to emerge from COVID-19 first.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "But our 2030 target of $10 to $15 per tonne increase is far too low. Some feel that it simply will not work as a way to slash emissions. IMF, which has one of the most conservative models out there, says our rate needs to be no lower than S$99 in 2030 to keep climate change at safe levels.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Even if we decide that $99 is too high, $15 is not anywhere near enough. We need to be honest with ourselves: without a high enough carbon tax, even with all the other things we do, our emission level might remain high \u2013 far too high.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Research studies from Ireland, Scotland and British Columbia find that a revenue-neutral carbon tax, where the money collected is poured back into the economy, could slash emissions while boosting the economy. That is the path we need to take. Mr Don Wee will share more of his thoughts on this topic. Mr Henry Kwek will also share his views about cutting our emissions.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "The second topic is professionalisation of the carbon documentation industry to heed the UN's call for global harmonisation of carbon documentation standards.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "The third topic is embedding sustainability into our industry transformation maps (ITM) or having an ITM for the sustainability sector.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Both of these topics flow from the reality that climate change is terrible, but the fight against it can create good jobs for Singaporeans and grow our economy. Miss Cheryl Chan will share her take on these two topics.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "The fourth topic is the Green Mark scheme. Green Mark sets standards and certifies sustainable construction. It is a good idea, but its standards need to be improved.\u00a0A Green Mark Silver or Green Mark Gold building, today, may not be very green at all. The scheme needs to be tightened. Ms Poh Li San will speak on this topic.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "The fifth topic is climate education and the sixth topic is increasing public access to emissions data of top-emitting entities. Both of these topics are about empowering our citizens. How can we teach our young ones about climate change? What can we do for them outside the classroom? And can we release more data on carbon emissions to the public?\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Sustainability is an increasingly integral part of people's lives. We must provide the education and the data needed for people to act in line with their moral compass. This will also help Singapore cut emissions. Ms Nadia Samdin will share more on the topic and Ms Hany Soh will also speak about community involvement.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "The seventh topic is charging points for electrical vehicles or EVs. EVs are the future of motor vehicles. Singapore aims to phase out cars with internal combustion engines by 2040. But this shift will be hard if we do not have enough charging points for them. The Government needs the private sector to build more charging points. We need to find new ways to help them do so. Mr Gan Thiam Poh will speak on this topic.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Mr Gan will also speak on the eighth topic, data-sharing mechanisms. The world of business competition is a treacherous place, but robust data-sharing frameworks can help provide the trust needed for industry players to share data, become more efficient and reduce emissions.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "The ninth topic is climate defence. Total Defence has six pillars. It is time to add climate defence as the seventh pillar to reflect how climate change is an existential threat for Singapore. Mr. Seah Kian Peng is passionate about this topic and will discuss this in his speech.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Beyond the 10 topics, we are all also concerned about our forests in Singapore. Recently, the Government shared an environmental baseline study carried out by HDB to guide future plans to the Dover, or I should correct it now, Ulu Pandan Forest. I thank HDB for consulting nature groups on the findings and also publishing the study online to seek further public views. I thank Minister for his comprehensive reply during Question Time earlier.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Many Singaporeans have spoken up. I share their concerns and I too hope that the Ulu Pandan Forest and other forests like the Clementi Forest will be protected. I believe we can work together to find a middle ground and embrace sustainability in the development of Singapore.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Sir, our forests are carbon sinks. They are our vanguard in our\u00a0fight against climate change. In fact, because we have cut down so much forest in recent years, Singapore's land now emits more carbon than it absorbs. It is needless to say that forests are also sites of great, irreplaceable biodiversity.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "The importance of biodiversity in forests is why when I amended the Wild Animals and Birds Act through a Private Member's Bill last year. We included a new section 10 that empowers the Director-General, Wildlife Management to \"issue directions to developers to carry out wildlife-related measures to safeguard wildlife, public health or safety, or the health of the eco-system.\" This was meant to give our Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reports more teeth. It also allows wildlife-related conditions in our EIA reports to be formally issued as directions. Developers must comply, or they may be punished by $50,000 fines or six months' imprisonment.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Sir, I am glad that there is good news in that we are protecting more green spaces that were previously not protected. Indeed, we are setting up the new Khatib Bongsu Nature Park and the Sungei Buloh Nature Park Network. I have brought many people, young and old to explore Khatib Bongsu in the past few months and they are all in awe of the amazing biodiversity we have in Singapore and the need to conserve the precious green spaces we have left.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Just last Saturday, my GRC colleague, Mr Derrick Goh and I kayaked with students from Secondary schools in Nee Soon to explore Khatib Bongsu. The kids are now brainstorming and coming up with ideas on how to build this new nature park. They are excited. There is more we can do to protect our flora and fauna. It starts by not destroying the natural habitat.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Many of these species have inhabited this land long before us. They bring life to our island. They remind Singaporeans that a world exists beyond the containers of steel, glass and concrete that we live in. They provide enriching spaces for scientific research. We call it nature, but it is also identity and it is also heritage. Buildings can be rebuilt. Art can be preserved. But it will take hundreds, if not thousands, of years before a living, breathing eco-system like a forest regrows itself.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Sir, we have committed to planting a million trees in Singapore over the next 10 years.

Sadness because we are somehow fighting the same battle that our forefathers fought decades ago. But, also optimism \u2013 because we are now much clearer about what we can do. Optimism because Singaporeans, more than ever before, are speaking up and taking action.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "The Government is listening and has done a great deal. We are spending more than $1 billion in carbon tax revenue for the next five years to help our industries become more efficient. We are building solar panels on our flats, reservoirs, ports and even airbases to increase our use of renewable energy. We are making aggressive plans to replace conventional vehicles with EVs and hybrids to cut transport emissions. We are facilitating green loans and green bonds to help green businesses grow. We are making big bets on carbon capture, hydrogen and other aspects of climate science as part of a massive $25 billion research blueprint.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "We are doing a lot. But still, we need to do more. Let us deepen and accelerate our climate change efforts. Let us slash our emissions while building new industries and creating new jobs.

I want to thank Mr Louis Ng for raising this Motion as I believe it to be particularly important. Singapore has long been renowned globally for being a City in a Garden and that status allows us to play our small part on the world stage. For example, Singapore played an instrumental role behind the scenes in the build-up to the signing of the Paris Agreement in December 2015. In fact, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan played a major role in that. This was recognised\u00a0by then President of the United States Barack Obama when Prime Minister Lee made a State Visit to Washington DC in 2016.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Furthermore, we are known for our efforts in promoting regional sustainability. In 2014, during the peak of the haze period, we passed the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act that allowed regulators to prosecute local and foreign companies that engaged in illegal forest burning that causes severe air pollution.

We can do our part, our small part to arrest climate change.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Mr Speaker, Singapore, as a global city, is poised to play a critical role toward regional urban sustainable development through a more comprehensive ecological assets and biodiversity value framework. To realise this vision, we must think out of our island-box when it comes to climate change impact and possibilities.

By this, I mean that sustainability should not be just a conversation or creed, but sustainability by deed. It should be a fact of life. In everyday living, residents should be reducing, reusing, recycling and even upcycling. In my ward in 2019, we held a series of events at Old Holland neighbourhood aimed at reducing the use of plastics, especially single-use plastics. All the residents were encouraged to bring their own water bottles and no disposable cutlery was used at the event.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "There are many other avenues and initiatives aimed at reducing use of plastic.

As we intensify the use of our land to fit our growing population, it is similarly important to continue providing access to nature for our residents so as to counter a nature deficit.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Let me give you an illustration. One aspiration I have for Ulu Pandan is to partner with NParks in building a nature trail from Holland Green Linear Park that will weave its wave through the contours of Clementi Forest all the way to Clementi Road.

Just recently, at the Climate Ambition Summit 2020, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all governments to declare a state of climate emergency. Our Government has also acknowledged the threat of climate change and put in place a number of strategies to tackle this global issue. But are we doing enough as a nation? Are we acknowledging the climate emergency for what it is?\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "In March 2020, Singapore submitted an updated Nationally Determined Contribution to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). While we previously committed to reduce our Emissions Intensity levels on a per dollar of GDP basis, the new NDC adopts an absolute emissions target instead. This is a step forward as it provides greater transparency and reinforces the Government\u2019s commitment to tackling climate change.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "However, when we take a closer look at the updated target, how much has actually changed?\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "The first NDC, submitted in 2015, stated our intention to reduce emissions intensity by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030, and this will imply emissions at around 65 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) with the aim of peaking around 2030. Similarly, the updated NDC reiterates that Singapore intends to peak emissions at 65 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission around 2030, and only reach net-zero emissions \u201cas soon as viable\u201d in the second half of the century. While we now have an absolute emissions target, this absolute figure of 65 MtCO2e is actually equivalent to the 36% reduction in Emissions Intensity from 2005 levels by 2030 and, hence, it is the exact same target that was set back in 2015.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "To put it bluntly, the updated target does not genuinely limit emissions growth today beyond what was already committed to under our first NDC.\u00a0I recognise that the Government is targeting 33 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, which is half that of the 65 million tonnes around 2030. As a nation, Singapore\u2019s climate targets still fall short of IPCC\u2019s recommendations to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. In contrast, the European Union, Japan and the Republic of Korea have pledged carbon neutrality by 2050, along with more than 110 other countries. Even China, the world\u2019s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, is pledging to reach carbon neutrality by 2060.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Even as a small island-state, Singapore has always been daring in our vision for the future.

Yet, we were still able to\u00a0punctually achieve our 2020 solar deployment target of 350 megawatt-peak in the first\u00a0quarter of 2020, reaching 1.5 gigawatt-peak by 2025 and at least 2 gigawatt-peak by\u00a02030. Solar, however, is only expected to contribute 3% of our electricity needs. Are we\u00a0genuinely pushing the boundaries, or simply setting benchmarks we can easily hit?\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Earlier, in January this year, I asked the Minister for Trade and Industry on whether we have\u00a0a target mix for the amount of electricity generated from renewable energy sources in 2030\u00a0and 2050, and if we would consider setting a target mix that we can strive for together as a\u00a0nation. However, I do not recall such a target being shared. The Workers\u2019 Party previously\u00a0called for a minimum of 10% of Singapore\u2019s energy to come from renewable resources by\u00a02025. The IEA also estimates that 30% of electricity generation globally in 2020 is already from\u00a0renewable sources. A starting point for us then is having a target in the first place.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Secondly, the carbon tax is another area with much potential for impact. To put it simply, the IMF has described carbon pricing as the \u201csingle most\u00a0powerful\u201d way to combat climate change. It is commendable that Singapore implemented a\u00a0carbon tax in 2019, the first nation in Southeast Asia to do so. But the current rate of\u00a0$5/tCO2e, however, is too nominal, sitting far below global scientific recommendations.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "I fully recognise that this is a sensitive period to be raising the carbon tax and also note the Government\u2019s plans to review the tax rate by 2023, and increase it to between $10/tCO2e\u00a0and $15/tCO2e by 2030. As Member Louis Ng said earlier in his speech, this is far too low. I urge the Government to adopt a carbon price\u00a0trajectory that is better aligned with the latest research on what is effective. It should also\u00a0be complemented by financial assistance schemes to help cushion the impact of the carbon\u00a0tax for lower income households.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Thirdly, Singapore\u2019s refining and petrochemical sector remains an elephant in the room in\u00a0our discussions on climate change. In 2017, about 75% of our industrial emissions were from\u00a0this sector. There is, therefore, an urgent need to consider the role such industries will play in\u00a0the Singapore economy of 2050 and beyond.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Already, we are starting to see key players restructure and pivot towards cleaner energy\u00a0sources, particularly in the wake of COVID-19's impact on energy demand and prices.

Shell is investing in more lower carbon technology while expanding its renewable\u00a0energy and power division. Thus far, the Government has been advocating for a practical\u00a0approach, a realistic approach towards the petrochemical industry, given that it is a key\u00a0employer and a key contributor to our economy today.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "However, we are already seeing signs of the practical changes oil majors are making today,\u00a0in preparing for their companies\u2019 realistic future.

Closer to home, Shell is targeting to cut 500\u00a0jobs by 2023 at Pulau Bukom from the current 1,300 staff today, and with refining capacity\u00a0halved in the next one to two years.\n", "sentiment": 0}, {"text": "Given Singapore\u2019s position as a leading oil and gas hub in Asia, it is inevitable that such\u00a0changes will impact our economy. Yet, should our focus still remain on the old economy\u00a0industries of the past? With oil majors pivoting away from fossil fuels, should Singapore not proactively engage these companies, to partner them on their journey to a net-zero\u00a0future? How can we accelerate the restructuring of our economy to be better prepared\u00a0for a low-carbon future which is fast approaching?\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "This brings me to my fourth and final point, on Singapore\u2019s potential to successfully drive\u00a0the green revolution, if we genuinely commit to accelerating our efforts on this front. This is\u00a0not the first time we are breaking new ground for Singapore. Shell built an oil refinery on\u00a0Pulau Bukom in 1961 and it was the first foreign investor to receive Singapore\u2019s Pioneer\u00a0Certificate Number 1 for its investment.

Yet, even as we reduce the emission, we must assume electricity demand will grow as we seek to improve our people's lives and livelihoods.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Therefore, our top challenge is how to have sufficient low-carbon power generation capacity, which must supply most of our future energy needs.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Getting there by adapting our natural gas power generation infrastructure is not easy.

I am glad to hear many inspirational speeches in this Chamber, including from Workers' Party and Progress Singapore Party. Inspirational speeches inspire, but they are not sufficient.

Specifics matter, especially on concrete matters on that, in its entirety, can allow us to meet this ambitious targets. What I hope is that, when we propose ideas in this Chambers, they are grounded on realities especially technological realities and informed by consultations of stakeholders from all walks of life and that we explain it to our people in plain simple terms, the trade-offs. Be it giving up on national securities when we import too much low-carbon electricity or higher cost of living or losing one's livelihood or let us say, less BTOs for young people.

We must also not rush to import too much renewable electricity now, so that we at least have headroom left \u2013\u00a0by that, I mean the option of importing more renewable electricity later on \u2013 so that we can continue to improve our lives and livelihoods immediately post 2030, because of the hard limit I spoke earlier about being overly reliant on imported electricity.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Two, I hope we can continue to invest and explore all technologies and infrastructure. The Government is doing a lot now including carbon mineralisation, investments in the hydrogen economy, encouraging Electric Vehicles or EVs.\u00a0But the technology path ahead is not so clear for Singapore. Therefore, we should hedge our bets by exploring even unusual renewable sources, such as geothermal solutions; by exploring hydrogen based fuel cell car and biofuel options, instead of just relying purely on EVs because that would tax our electrical system and by actively investing in critical energy infrastructure ahead of time, such as, in the future, a liquified hydrogen import terminal, so that the industry has viable alternative renewable energy imports.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "We must also be open to ideas, innovations from not just large renewable companies, but also from innovative non-incumbent players too.\u00a0And create sandboxes for new ideas to be piloted. Because this is one sector where new players have consistently made an impact. And we can weaved all this into an integrated policy and technology road map much like the visionary Reinventing Fire plans that the US and China separately did through the America's Rocky Mountain Institute.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Three, we can put in even more incentives beyond what we have pledged previously, to help our industries, achieve efficiency. In particular, I hope we can come up with a determined effort to reduce emission from our petrochemical industry. We can also revise our Green Mark incentives, to reduce emissions for both new and existing commercial buildings. While I am cautious about increasing carbon tax amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear to me that over time, our carbon price must trend towards the international norms.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Four, create an open and transparent process on climate change debate, as I mentioned in my opening speech in the debate on the President's Address.\u00a0To Singaporeans, open and transparent process is just as important as an effective outcome. The Government can open up our plans more regularly, to share to people what we are confident to achieve and to also seek collaboration from everybody, in areas we have less confidence in achieving.\u00a0This process will encourage and increase trust.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "Lastly, I would like to talk about how we can contribute beyond our Paris accord commitments.\u00a0A number of Singaporeans and climate change believers have strongly suggested that Singapore should achieve net zero as early as possible.

I understand where they are coming from.\u00a0As a Government, we are mere custodians of Singapore for future generations.\u00a0We have a moral obligation to leave behind an inhabitable earth.\u00a0But we also have an obligation to the livelihoods of our people.\n", "sentiment": 1}, {"text": "So, let me state the obvious\u00a0\u2013 Singapore is probably one of the least efficient countries to be a carbon sink.
