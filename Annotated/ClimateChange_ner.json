Rising sea levels may put coastal areas underwater. Floods may become more frequent. Developers will have to build at higher levels than before.

And I remember the immense pride I felt as a very young Singaporean.","entities":[[18,23,"DATE"],[130,135,"DATE"],[146,151,"DATE"],[208,236,"FAC"],[289,306,"GPE"],[351,362,"NORP"],[394,403,"GPE"],[434,443,"GPE"],[603,614,"NORP"]]},{"content":"I think our youths today are ready to be even prouder of Singapore, especially if Singapore takes seriously and demonstrates global leadership in the many causes that our youths care deeply and passionately about, including climate change.","entities":[[19,24,"DATE"],[57,66,"GPE"],[82,91,"GPE"]]},{"content":"Of course, climate change is a problem much bigger than Singapore. But tackling this problem is also an opportunity for us to be part of something much bigger than ourselves, and be proud of it.","entities":[[56,65,"GPE"]]},{"content":": Mr Henry Kwek.","entities":[[2,15,"PERSON"]]},{"content":"Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru)","entities":[[0,24,"PERSON"]]},{"content":": Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of the Motion. Today, I would like to speak on how we can achieve our ambitious target of peaking emissions in 2030 and then halving it by 2050. I also urge Singapore to do more, by building a carbon offset industry overseas.","entities":[[45,51,"LAW"],[149,153,"DATE"],[177,181,"DATE"],[195,204,"GPE"]]},{"content":"We could, of course, go nuclear. But I doubt Singaporeans will be comfortable with that. And given our lack of renewable energy locally because of our intermittent sunlight, we must rely on imports which means either import direct low-carbon electricity imports or low-carbon energy imports like hydrogen. So, electricity or hydrogen.","entities":[[45,57,"NORP"]]},{"content":"At the same time, the possible low-carbon import – hydrogen, is far from ready. It takes many years to develop hydrogen based energy infrastructure and transportation. Will hydrogen be ready by 2030? By ready, it does not mean ready in the lab but ready in terms of infrastructure, in terms of ships that can ship liquified versions of it. The answer is, in my view, no.","entities":[[194,198,"DATE"]]},{"content":"Therefore, if we expect our emissions to decrease steadily immediately after 2030, in the immediate years, before affordable low-carbon power generation options are ready, low-carbon electricity will be Singapore's growth and societal constraint. Will we see a contentious debate on who gets the first dip on scarce low-carbon electricity, much like the issue of how foreign manpower divided Singapore in the past decade?  We will be facing stark trade-offs then unless everybody, Government, industry, people, civil society start moving now.","entities":[[77,81,"DATE"],[203,212,"GPE"],[392,401,"GPE"]]},{"content":"And at this juncture, let me make a broader point. I am glad to hear many inspirational speeches in this Chamber, including from Workers' Party and Progress Singapore Party. Inspirational speeches inspire, but they are not sufficient. For something as important as climate change, we must go beyond saying \"do more, do more\". Specifics matter, especially on concrete matters on that, in its entirety, can allow us to meet this ambitious targets. What I hope is that, when we propose ideas in this Chambers, they are grounded on realities especially technological realities and informed by consultations of stakeholders from all walks of life and that we explain it to our people in plain simple terms, the trade-offs. Be it giving up on national securities when we import too much low-carbon electricity or higher cost of living or losing one's livelihood or let us say, less BTOs for young people. Only when the policy is debated and discussed in this manner, can we fully expect Singaporeans to buy in what we decide in this Chamber.","entities":[[129,143,"NORP"],[148,172,"NORP"],[981,993,"NORP"]]},{"content":"One, pace ourselves. As explained earlier, there will be a crunch in low-carbon electricity immediately after 2030, until technology matures. Therefore, when we grow our industries, we must start treating electricity as a scarce growth constraint, much as we treat foreign manpower today. We must also not rush to import too much renewable electricity now, so that we at least have headroom left – by that, I mean the option of importing more renewable electricity later on – so that we can continue to improve our lives and livelihoods immediately post 2030, because of the hard limit I spoke earlier about being overly reliant on imported electricity.","entities":[[110,114,"DATE"],[554,558,"DATE"]]},{"content":"Two, I hope we can continue to invest and explore all technologies and infrastructure. The Government is doing a lot now including carbon mineralisation, investments in the hydrogen economy, encouraging Electric Vehicles or EVs. But the technology path ahead is not so clear for Singapore. Therefore, we should hedge our bets by exploring even unusual renewable sources, such as geothermal solutions; by exploring hydrogen based fuel cell car and biofuel options, instead of just relying purely on EVs because that would tax our electrical system and by actively investing in critical energy infrastructure ahead of time, such as, in the future, a liquified hydrogen import terminal, so that the industry has viable alternative renewable energy imports.","entities":[[91,101,"ORG"],[279,288,"GPE"]]},{"content":"We must also be open to ideas, innovations from not just large renewable companies, but also from innovative non-incumbent players too. And create sandboxes for new ideas to be piloted. Because this is one sector where new players have consistently made an impact. And we can weaved all this into an integrated policy and technology road map much like the visionary Reinventing Fire plans that the US and China separately did through the America's Rocky Mountain Institute.","entities":[[398,400,"GPE"],[405,410,"GPE"],[438,445,"GPE"]]},{"content":"Four, create an open and transparent process on climate change debate, as I mentioned in my opening speech in the debate on the President's Address. To Singaporeans, open and transparent process is just as important as an effective outcome. The Government can open up our plans more regularly, to share to people what we are confident to achieve and to also seek collaboration from everybody, in areas we have less confidence in achieving. This process will encourage and increase trust.","entities":[[152,164,"NORP"],[245,255,"ORG"]]},{"content":"Lastly, I would like to talk about how we can contribute beyond our Paris accord commitments. A number of Singaporeans and climate change believers have strongly suggested that Singapore should achieve net zero as early as possible. In fact, I also heard some of my Parliamentary colleagues mention it today. I understand where they are coming from. As a Government, we are mere custodians of Singapore for future generations. We have a moral obligation to leave behind an inhabitable earth. But we also have an obligation to the livelihoods of our people.","entities":[[68,73,"GPE"],[106,118,"NORP"],[177,186,"GPE"],[355,365,"ORG"],[393,402,"GPE"]]},{"content":"So, let me state the obvious – Singapore is probably one of the least efficient countries to be a carbon sink. But I strongly feel that we can do more to live up to our moral responsibility and go beyond halving our emissions. How? Well, as a country, we can go all out to develop carbon offsets beyond Singapore. The means of doing so, the technology of doing so, is already there. By that, I mean planting trees. Indeed, can Singapore be a big player in reforesting our region, or even the rapidly diminishing Amazon rainforest?","entities":[[31,40,"GPE"],[303,312,"GPE"]]},{"content":"If Singapore or our GLCs come in, in a big way, perhaps backed by MAS' green bonds, we can shape this nascent industry which currently operates without robust standards.

Some people will say that carbon offsets overseas do not accrue towards our national targets. It is true, but I would say that there is nothing wrong with helping other countries meet their tough targets, especially when we all know the lack of watertight reporting under the Paris accord means that the real emission situation is probably and definitely much worse than reported as progress.","entities":[[17,26,"GPE"],[203,212,"GPE"],[490,495,"GPE"]]},{"content":"We can complement this carbon offset industry by developing Singapore into a leading and trusted professional services hub for emissions and carbon accounting.
